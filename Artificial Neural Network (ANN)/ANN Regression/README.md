ANN model is used for Supervised Learning and here we will apply this ANN model for predicting continuous value, i.e ANN with Regression. Here, we have a dataset having columns(corresponding to power plant) : Atmospheric Temperature Vaccum Atmospheric Pressure Relative Humidity and we will be predicting Electrical Energy Output using ANN. When our model is trained on 30 epoch, we get a loss of 34% on test set and that's an satisfying result.
